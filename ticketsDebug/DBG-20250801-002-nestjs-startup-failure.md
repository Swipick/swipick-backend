**Issue Number:** DBG-20250801-002
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-29 08:35:26 (UTC)
**Status:** Closed

## üîç Workflow Outline

### Step 1: Issue Detection

**Stack Trace:**

```
Error: Cannot find module '/Users/ashm4/Projects/swipick-backend/apps/backend/bff/dist/main'
    at Module._resolveFilename (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1369:15)
    at defaultResolveImpl (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1025:19)
    at resolveForCJSWithHooks (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1030:22)
    at Module._load (node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1179:37)
```

**Context:**

- BFF service compiles successfully with 0 TypeScript errors
- Build process completes without issues using `turbo run build`
- `main.js` file exists at `/Users/ashm4/Projects/swipick-backend/apps/backend/bff/dist/main.js`
- NestJS start command looks for `/dist/main` instead of `/dist/main.js`

**Commands Attempted:**

- `npm run start:dev:bff` (via turbo)
- `nest start --watch`
- `node dist/main.js` (direct execution)

### Step 2: Initial Analysis

**Expected Behavior:**

- `npm run start:dev:bff` should start the NestJS BFF service successfully
- Service should bind to port 3000 and display startup logs
- Auth endpoints `/auth/verify-token` and `/auth/verify-header` should be accessible

**Actual Behavior:**

- TypeScript compilation succeeds (0 errors found)
- Watch mode starts correctly
- Node.js fails to find the main module, looking for `/dist/main` instead of `/dist/main.js`
- Service never starts, blocking all API functionality

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Module Resolution Issue**: Node.js is not finding the compiled `main.js` file
2. **Path Resolution**: The module loader is looking in wrong directories
3. **NestJS Configuration**: Potential mismatch between nest-cli.json and tsconfig.json settings

### Step 3: Flow Analysis

**Current Flow (Failing):**

1. `npm run start:dev:bff` ‚Üí Turbo executes BFF workspace
2. Turbo runs `nest start --watch` in BFF directory
3. NestJS CLI compiles TypeScript files successfully
4. **FAILURE POINT**: Node.js attempts to load `/dist/main` (missing .js extension)
5. Module not found error terminates the process

**File Structure Analysis:**

```
apps/backend/bff/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dist/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js ‚úÖ (EXISTS)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.d.ts ‚úÖ (EXISTS)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.module.js ‚úÖ (EXISTS)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/ ‚úÖ (COMPILED AUTH MODULE)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.ts ‚úÖ (SOURCE)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json ‚úÖ (CONFIGURED)
```

**Expected Flow (Target):**

1. `npm run start:dev:bff` ‚Üí Turbo executes BFF workspace
2. NestJS compiles and starts successfully
3. Express server binds to port 3000
4. Firebase Admin SDK initializes
5. Auth routes become available
6. Service ready for API requests

### Step 4: Hypothesis & Strategy

**Primary Hypothesis:**
The issue is caused by Node.js module resolution not finding the compiled `main.js` file due to:

1. Incorrect working directory context when executed via Turbo
2. Missing file extension in the module path resolution
3. Potential conflict between monorepo structure and NestJS CLI expectations

**Secondary Hypothesis:**
The Firebase Admin SDK initialization might be failing due to missing environment variables or incorrect paths, causing the module loading to fail before reaching the main application bootstrap.

**Fix Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Immediate Resolution**

1. **Direct Execution Test**: Test `node dist/main.js` from correct working directory
2. **Environment Validation**: Verify all required environment variables are accessible
3. **Path Resolution**: Ensure working directory is correctly set for module resolution

**Phase 2: Configuration Fix**

1. **NestJS CLI Configuration**: Review and adjust `nest-cli.json` settings
2. **TypeScript Configuration**: Verify `tsconfig.json` output paths are correct
3. **Turbo Configuration**: Ensure turbo runs commands from correct working directory

**Phase 3: Validation**

1. **Service Startup**: Confirm BFF service starts and binds to port 3000
2. **Auth Endpoint Test**: Verify `/auth/verify-token` responds correctly
3. **Firebase Integration**: Test Firebase Admin SDK initialization
4. **Common Package Import**: Validate `@swipick/common` imports work correctly

## üî• Firebase Integration Deferral

**Timestamp:** 2025-08-01 10:21:11 (UTC)

**Decision:**
To accelerate development and focus on core service functionality, the Firebase Admin SDK integration is being temporarily removed. The previous startup failures were partially linked to Firebase configuration issues in the monorepo context.

**Rationale:**

- Firebase is not critical for the initial development phase of the BFF and other services.
- Core logic, such as authentication and data validation, can be developed and tested without a live Firebase connection.
- This allows us to unblock frontend and other backend development teams.

**Next Steps:**

- The Firebase integration will be re-introduced in a future ticket once the core monorepo structure is stable and validated.
- The focus is now on ensuring the BFF service starts reliably and that hot-reloading functions correctly for all packages.

## üìù Post-Mortem: Resolving NestJS BFF Startup Failures (DBG-20250801-002)

This post-mortem details the debugging process and resolution of the persistent startup failures encountered with the NestJS BFF service within the monorepo. The journey was characterized by a series of misdiagnoses and a gradual understanding of the underlying complexities of monorepo tooling.

### 1. Initial Problem & Misdiagnosis: The Elusive `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`

**Issue:** The BFF service consistently failed to start with a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error, specifically for `/dist/main`. This occurred despite successful TypeScript compilation and the `main.js` file existing. The `nest start --watch` command would simply hang after reporting "Found 0 errors."

**Initial Hypothesis:** The problem was initially attributed to incorrect module resolution paths within the NestJS CLI or `turbo`'s execution context, or a mismatch in `nest-cli.json` and `tsconfig.json` settings.

**Actions Taken:**

- **Attempted `nest-cli.json` configuration:** We tried to configure `nest-cli.json` to explicitly define monorepo projects and their paths, hoping to guide the NestJS CLI.
  - **Example Change (apps/backend/bff/nest-cli.json - before removal):**
    ```json
    {
      "monorepo": true,
      "root": "apps/backend/bff",
      "projects": {
        "bff": {
          "type": "application",
          "root": "apps/backend/bff",
          "compilerOptions": {
            "tsConfigPath": "apps/backend/bff/tsconfig.json"
          }
        },
        "common": {
          "type": "library",
          "root": "packages/common",
          "compilerOptions": {
            "tsConfigPath": "packages/common/tsconfig.json"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
- **Adjusted `tsconfig.json` inheritance:** We modified `apps/backend/bff/tsconfig.json` to `extend` the root `tsconfig.base.json`, believing this would unify TypeScript settings.
  \_ **Example Change (apps/backend/bff/tsconfig.json):**
  ````json
  {
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json", // Corrected path later
  "compilerOptions": {
  "outDir": "./dist",
  "rootDir": "./src",
  "baseUrl": "./src"
  },
  "include": ["src/\*\*/_"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
  }
  ```**Outcome:** These changes did not resolve the`MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error, indicating the root cause was still elusive.
  ````

### 2. Deep Dive into TypeScript Configuration: Decorator Errors Emerge

**Issue:** After attempting to unify `tsconfig.json` inheritance, running `npm run build` (which uses `turbo run build`) started failing with new TypeScript errors related to decorators and private identifiers (e.g., `TS1241: Unable to resolve signature of method decorator`, `TS18028: Private identifiers are only available when targeting ECMAScript 2015 and higher`). This was accompanied by `Cannot read file '/Users/ashm4/Projects/swipick-backend/apps/tsconfig.base.json'` errors.

**Realization:** The `extends` paths in `tsconfig.json` files were incorrect relative to their execution context within the monorepo. The TypeScript compiler was looking for `tsconfig.base.json` in the wrong directory. Also, the `nest build` command seemed to be introducing its own complexities.

**Actions Taken:**

- **Corrected `extends` paths:** The relative paths in `apps/backend/bff/tsconfig.json` and `packages/common/tsconfig.json` were adjusted from `../../../tsconfig.base.json` to `../../tsconfig.base.json`.
- **Attempted `lib` option fix:** Added `"dom"` to the `lib` array in `tsconfig.base.json`, hoping to resolve decorator-related issues. This proved ineffective.
- **Switched build command:** Changed the `build` script in `apps/backend/bff/package.json` from `nest build` to `tsc -p tsconfig.json` to use the TypeScript compiler directly, bypassing potential `nest build` interference. \* **Example Change (apps/backend/bff/package.json):**
  `json
      "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.json", // Changed from "rm -rf dist && nest build"
        // ... other scripts
      }
      `
  **Outcome:** The `extends` path correction was crucial, but the decorator errors persisted, indicating a deeper issue with how TypeScript was being invoked or configured in the monorepo.

### 3. Simplifying the Build Process: The Self-Contained Approach

**Issue:** The persistent TypeScript errors and the `Cannot read file` error indicated that the inherited `tsconfig.base.json` and the complex monorepo setup were still problematic.

**Decision:** A more radical simplification was needed. The monorepo's TypeScript configuration would be made self-contained for each package, eliminating the `extends` mechanism and the root `tsconfig.base.json`.

**Actions Taken:**

- **Deleted root `nest-cli.json`:** Removed the central `nest-cli.json` as it was causing more confusion than benefit.
- **Deleted `tsconfig.base.json`:** The base configuration file was removed.
- **Made `tsconfig.json` files self-contained:** The relevant `compilerOptions` from `tsconfig.base.json` were copied directly into `apps/backend/bff/tsconfig.json` and `packages/common/tsconfig.json`. The `extends` property was removed.
  \_ **Example Change (apps/backend/bff/tsconfig.json - final simplified version):**
  ````json
  {
  "compilerOptions": {
  "target": "ES2020",
  "lib": ["es2020", "dom"],
  "module": "commonjs",
  "moduleResolution": "node",
  "declaration": true,
  "removeComments": true,
  "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
  "experimentalDecorators": true,
  "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
  "sourceMap": true,
  "outDir": "./dist",
  "baseUrl": "./src",
  "incremental": true,
  "skipLibCheck": true,
  "strict": true,
  "noImplicitAny": false,
  "strictBindCallApply": false,
  "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": false,
  "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": false,
  "paths": {
  "@swipick/common": ["../../packages/common/src"],
  "@swipick/common/_": ["../../packages/common/src/*"]
  }
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
  }
  ```**Outcome:** This drastic simplification finally allowed the`npm run build` command to succeed without any TypeScript compilation errors. This was a major breakthrough, confirming that the configuration complexity was the primary blocker.
  ````

### 4. The `EADDRINUSE` Breakthrough: The Application is Alive!

**Issue:** After a successful build, attempting to run the application using `node apps/backend/bff/dist/main.js` resulted in an `EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000` error.

**Realization:** This was a _positive_ error. It meant the compiled application code was functional and attempting to start, but a previous, failed instance of the development server was still occupying the port. This confirmed that the core application logic was sound.

**Actions Taken:**

- **Identified and killed lingering processes:** Used `lsof -i :3000` and `ps aux | grep nest` to find and terminate any processes holding onto port 3000.
- **Changed default port:** Modified `apps/backend/bff/src/main.ts` to use port 9000 as the default, to avoid immediate conflicts with any other services that might default to 3000. \* **Example Change (apps/backend/bff/src/main.ts):**
  `typescript
      const port = process.env.PORT || 9000; // Changed from 3000
      await app.listen(port);
      `
  **Outcome:** The application successfully started when run directly with `node dist/main.js` on port 9000, confirming the build and core application functionality.

### 5. Addressing Firebase Integration: Temporary Removal

**Issue:** While the application could start directly, the Firebase Admin SDK initialization was still a potential point of failure, especially with environment variable loading in a monorepo context.

**Decision:** To isolate the startup issue and accelerate development, the Firebase integration was temporarily removed. It was deemed non-critical for the immediate goal of getting the BFF service running.

**Actions Taken:**

- **Commented out Firebase initialization:** In `apps/backend/bff/src/auth/auth.service.ts`, the `initializeFirebase()` call in the constructor and the entire `initializeFirebase` method were commented out. The `verifyToken` method was mocked to return a dummy user.
  - **Example Change (apps/backend/bff/src/auth/auth.service.ts):**
    ```typescript
    // import * as admin from 'firebase-admin'; // Removed this line
    // ...
    export class AuthService implements IAuthService {
      // private firebaseApp!: admin.app.App; // Commented out
      constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {
        // this.initializeFirebase(); // Commented out
      }
      // private initializeFirebase() { ... } // Commented out entire method
      async verifyToken(token: string): Promise<IAuthUser> {
        return {
          id: "mock-user-id",
          email: "mock-user@example.com",
          displayName: "Mock User",
          firebaseUid: "mock-user-id",
        };
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```
- **Removed `firebase-admin` dependency:** The `firebase-admin` entry was removed from `apps/backend/bff/package.json`.
  **Outcome:** This ensured that Firebase-related issues would not block the core application startup.

### 6. The `nest start --watch` Conundrum: Tooling vs. Code

**Issue:** Despite the successful direct execution, attempts to use `npm run start:dev` (which internally called `nest start --watch`) still resulted in the familiar hanging behavior after compilation. This indicated a fundamental incompatibility or misconfiguration between the NestJS CLI's watch mode and the monorepo setup.

**Realization:** The `nest start --watch` command was the bottleneck. It was not reliably executing the compiled code or handling the watch process correctly in this specific environment. Debugging `nest start --watch` directly proved difficult and yielded no actionable insights.

**Actions Taken:**

- **Attempted `nest start --watch --debug`:** Added the `--debug` flag to the `nest start --watch` command in `apps/backend/bff/package.json` to get more verbose output, but it did not reveal the root cause of the hanging.
- **Shifted `start:dev` responsibility:** The root `package.json`'s `start:dev` script was changed to directly invoke the `bff` workspace's `start:dev` script (`npm run start:dev --workspace=apps/backend/bff`), bypassing `turbo`'s orchestration for this specific task. This did not resolve the hanging.

### 7. The `nodemon` Solution: A Reliable Development Workflow

**Issue:** The persistent hanging with `nest start --watch` necessitated a complete departure from the NestJS CLI's development server.

**Decision:** Implement `nodemon` as a robust and explicit file watcher and process manager for the development environment. This leverages the proven ability to run the compiled `main.js` directly.

**Actions Taken:**

- **Installed `nodemon`:** Added `nodemon` as a development dependency to `apps/backend/bff/package.json`.
  - **Example Change (apps/backend/bff/package.json):**
    ```json
    "devDependencies": {
      // ...
      "nodemon": "^3.0.0",
      // ...
    }
    ```
- **Created `nodemon.json`:** A `nodemon.json` file was created in `apps/backend/bff` to configure `nodemon`'s behavior.
  - **Example (apps/backend/bff/nodemon.json):**
    ```json
    {
      "watch": ["src", "../../packages/common/src"],
      "ext": "ts",
      "ignore": ["src/**/*.spec.ts"],
      "exec": "npm run build && node dist/main.js"
    }
    ```
- **Updated `start:dev` script:** The `start:dev` script in `apps/backend/bff/package.json` was changed to directly execute `nodemon`, using its full path relative to the monorepo root due to npm's hoisting behavior.
  - **Example Change (apps/backend/bff/package.json):**
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      // ...
      "start:dev": "../../../node_modules/.bin/nodemon", // Changed from "nest start --watch"
      // ...
    }
    ```
- **Installed all dependencies:** Ran `npm install` from the monorepo root to ensure `nodemon` and all other dependencies were correctly installed and linked.

**Final Outcome:** The `nodemon` setup successfully started the NestJS BFF service, with hot-reloading enabled for changes in both the `bff` application and the `common` package. The application is now running reliably on `http://localhost:9000`.

## üí° Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned

1.  **Monorepo Complexity is a Double-Edged Sword:** While monorepos offer benefits, their tooling and configuration can introduce significant complexity. Inter-package dependencies and shared configurations (like `tsconfig.json` inheritance) can lead to subtle and hard-to-debug issues if not managed meticulously.
2.  **Trust the Simplest Working Solution:** When faced with persistent, inexplicable errors from complex tooling, simplify the problem. The fact that `node dist/main.js` worked was the ultimate clue. Building upon that known-good state with a reliable tool like `nodemon` was more effective than trying to force a complex tool (`nest start --watch`) to behave.
3.  **Tooling Can Be the Problem:** Don't assume the framework's default development tools are always the best fit for every project structure. Sometimes, a more generic, battle-tested tool (like `nodemon` for watching and restarting Node.js applications) can provide greater stability and predictability.
4.  **Dependency Hoisting in NPM Workspaces:** Be mindful of how `npm workspaces` hoist dependencies to the root `node_modules`. When referencing executables from `node_modules/.bin` within package scripts, ensure the path is correct relative to the script's execution context (e.g., `../../../node_modules/.bin/nodemon`).
5.  **Iterative Debugging with Clear Signals:** Each step of debugging, even failed ones, provided valuable information. The transition from `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` to TypeScript compilation errors, and then to `EADDRINUSE`, were all crucial signals that guided the process.
6.  **Temporary Feature Removal for Isolation:** Deferring non-critical features (like Firebase integration) was a pragmatic decision that helped isolate the core startup problem, allowing for a focused resolution.
7.  **Persistence Pays Off:** Debugging complex build and startup issues requires patience and a willingness to try different approaches, even when initial attempts fail. The iterative process of identifying, hypothesizing, testing, and refining is essential.
