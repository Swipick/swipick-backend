# üõ†Ô∏è Ticket: Initialization of Backend

**Issue Number:** DBG-20250724-001
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-24 00:00:00 (UTC)
**Status:** Resolved

---

## üîç Workflow Outline

### Step 1: Purpose of Initialization

We need to establish the baseline folder structure, service skeletons, and tooling to enable independent service development and collaboration. Each part is necessary for:

- **apps/backend/**: Housing individual NestJS services (bff, match-service, etc.)
- **packages/common/**: Shared codebase for DTOs, interfaces, utils
- **infrastructure/**: For IaC using Terraform and Docker
- **.env files**: To centralize configuration for each service
- **turbo.json**: Orchestrate builds and test flow

Expected behavior:

- Clean dev startup (`npm run start:dev bff`)
- Shared types/interfaces work across services
- Ready-to-deploy Docker structure exists

### Step 2: Initial Steps

- Scaffold each service using `NestJS CLI`

  ```bash
  nest new apps/backend/bff
  nest new apps/backend/match-service
  ```

- Set up `packages/common/`
- Bootstrap monorepo with `turbo.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`
- Initialize `.env` files and connect `@nestjs/config`
- Add scripts to root `package.json` for service startup
- Add GitHub Actions CI for lint/test/build

### Step 3: Flow Analysis

1. Developer pulls the repo and installs dependencies
2. Runs `npm run start:dev bff`
3. BFF service bootstraps with Firebase Admin config
4. API `/auth/verify-token` is exposed
5. GitHub Actions validate each push/PR

### Step 4: Hypothesis & Strategy

By using a monorepo, shared tooling, and scaffolded NestJS services:

- We ensure code quality and dev consistency
- We reduce friction between services (shared types)
- We prepare for CI/CD integration with no redundant work

Strategy:

- Start with BFF only
- Then match-service with mocked API-FOOTBALL calls
- Confirm inter-service imports
